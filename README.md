## My process

At first, i wanted to use TailwindCSS, but then resorted to using pure CSS and HTML technology, as it is only intended to be a static webpage with a QR Code. I decided to use Tailwind for more complex projects.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Terraform (for cloud hosting)
- Responsive workflow

### What I learned

I learned that not always we NEED to use more complex tools to make a simple project, we can start by using the basics, we can still make beautiful responsive webpages with them.

### Continued development

I seem to have had a very good understanding of HTML and CSS while building this project, and i am proud of that, but i currently am seeking to understand more technologies such as TypeScript, React, MongoDB, and other full-stack web developer tools.

### Useful resources

- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) - GitHub Copilot was my goto when i was confused why something wasn't working the way i had intended, and helped me making this webpage. I really liked this AI duet pattern of development, not letting the AI drive the entire project, but help me being more productive and understand concepts i didn't know or forgot along the way.
- [W3S Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) - This is an amazing website with easy-to-access documentation on many programming languages, i used it to understand deeper contexts of what i was doing.
