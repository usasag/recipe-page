### Links

## My process

I did not use any CSS preprocessor this time, and i wanted to tackle the challenge with hands-on proper CSS and HTML.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties and @media
- Flexbox
- Responsive workflow

### What I learned

I learned that developing the front-end of a website requires more creativity than technical prowess, in fact.
It is a creative process in which you can plan a website using digital tools and then the only technical challenge is only the start of the process.

### Continued development

I seem to have had a very good understanding of HTML and CSS while building this project, and i am proud of that, but i currently am seeking to understand more technologies such as TypeScript, React, MongoDB, and other full-stack web developer tools.

### Useful resources

- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) - GitHub Copilot was my autocomplete tool and provides a lot of utility when it comes to productivity, i definitely recommend for anyone who is willing to use it.
- [W3S Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) - This is an amazing website with easy-to-access documentation on many programming languages, i used it to understand deeper contexts of what i was doing.
